### Setup

[GoRails](https://gorails.com/setup) has great Ruby on Rails setup instructions for macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. It goes through the general process to get up and running, but it doesnâ€™t cover everything, and it may be preferable to install each dependency following separate tutorials.

Workflow to setup an M1 MacBook:

1. Follow the latest [documentation](https://brew.sh/) to install Homebrew.

1. It's recommended to install Ruby on Rails with a version manager, like **rbenv**:

    ```
    brew install rbenv
    ```
    Then, ensure the version manager is loaded in your shell. For Macs using zsh, use `nano ~/.zshrc` to open the file and add the following lines of code:
    ```
    export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(rbenv init -)"
    ```
    Save, then restart with `source ~/.zshrc`.

1. Install **ruby**, **bundler**, and **rails** (see this tutorial by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-macos#step-2-installing-ruby)).

1. Install **node.js** with `brew install node`. This should also install **npm**.

1. Follow the latest [documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to install **yarn**.  (You may need to install **corepack**  if the first step in the yarn documentation fails.  `brew install corepack` )

1. Install **java** with `brew install java`, then follow the suggested commands to establish a symlink.

1. Install **mysql** with `brew install mysql`, then start the database with `brew services start mysql`. Optionally, run the suggested commands to secure the database.


### Configure GeoBlacklight

1. Clone the project:

    ```
    cd <your project directory>
    git clone git@github.com:/umass-gis/geoblacklight.git
    ```

1. Duplicate the .example files in the project and remove the .example string from each of their filename:
    
    ```
    cp .example.env.development .env.development  
    cp .example.env.test .env.test
    ```
    Then, update the MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD credentials in these files. These variables are called by `database.yml` when establishing a connection to the database.

1. Navigate to the project directory and install the **ruby gems** with `bundle install`.

1. Install the **yarn packages** with `yarn install`.

1. Create and migrate the databases:

    Development environment:
    ```
    bundle exec rails db:create
    bundle exec rails db:migrate
    ```
    Test environment:
    ```
    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:create
    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:migrate
    ```

### Run the Application

The rake task below will spin up Solr, index the test fixture documents, and start the default Rails web server.

```bash
bundle exec rake umass:server
```

* View the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* View the Solr admin panel at [http://localhost:8983](http://localhost:8983)

### Run the Test Suite

Stop any instances of GeoBlacklight before running this command.

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake ci
```

### Run the Rake Tasks for Solr

Delete all data from the Solr index

```bash
bundle exec rake umass:index:delete_all
```

Index just the UMass test fixtures

```bash
bundle exec rake rake umass:index:umass
```
