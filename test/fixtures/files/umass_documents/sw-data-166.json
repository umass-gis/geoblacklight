        "The purpose of the HPS database was to extract, standardize, and geocode the historical trade of vascular and non-vascular plant taxa sold in the horticultural industry of the conterminous United States. The database aims to serve as a resource for analysis of contemporary patterns of introduced and invasive plants as well as for identifying opportunities to expand native plant sales in horticulture. Key data sources that make up this database include the Biodiversity Heritage Library's Seed and Nursery Catalog Collection, and the book Restoring American Gardens by D.W. Adams. The dataset includes two files: a CSV of the plant taxa offered for sale by nurseries and seed houses in the conterminous U.S. (2.5+ million records) and a CSV of all unique plant taxa with resolved taxonomy (19,000+ records).."
