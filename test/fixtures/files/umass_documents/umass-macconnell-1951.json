      "Collection of 1:20,000 georeferenced black-and-white aerial photographs of Massachusetts taken in 1951-1952. The flights were commissioned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and flown by Robinson Aerial Surveys, Inc., Newark, NJ. This collection was analyzed as part of a statewide land-use study directed by William P. MacConnell and carried out by the Massachusetts Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, with support from the UMass Amherst Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the UMass Amherst Department of Natural Resources, and the Wildlife Management Institute. The teamâ€™s land use categorizations are inked directly onto many of the photos."
